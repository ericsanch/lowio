Low-Level IO Procedures in MASM

This program implements low-level input/output procedures using MASM. The program requests 10 signed integers from the user, conducts input validation routines on the user's input, and prints output. The output for this program consists of the user's selected integers, the sum, and the rounded average of the numbers. 

This program makes use of the system stack to store the user's values for summation and averaging. The program also uses **what type** division to determine the rounded average of the user's input.

This program was written for the final project of CS 271 at Oregon State University. The solution of this program is subject to all applicable Oregon State University academic policies. The solution of this program is provided for informative purposes only and should not be reproduced for submission in any academic setting.
